# Video parsing library

The purpose of this library is to propose a replacement to the closed and
proprietary NVIDIA's library used in [Vulkan Video
Samples](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_video_samples) and [Conformance
Test Suite](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS), with one using
[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/). It aims to be API compatible.

Currently only supports H.264 streams. H.265 is in the pipeline.
